## Issues, bugs, and requests

We welcome contributions and feedback on our website. 
Please file a request in our
[issue tracker](https://github.com/flutter/website/issues/new/choose) 
or create a [pull request](https://github.com/flutter/website/pulls). 
For simple changes (such as tweaking some text), 
it's easiest to make changes using the GitHub UI.

If you have an issue with the 
API docs on [api.flutter.dev](https://api.flutter.dev), 
please file those issues on 
the [flutter/flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues) repo, 
not on this (flutter/website) repo. 
The API docs are embedded in Flutter's source code, 
so the engineering team handles those.


## Before you submit a PR

We love it when the community gets involved in improving our docs! 
But here are a few notes to keep in mind before you submit a PR:

- When triaging issues, 
  we sometimes label an issue with the tag **PRs welcome**. 
  But we welcome PRs on other issues as well&mdash;
  it doesn't have to be tagged with that label.
- Please don't run our docs through Grammarly (or similar) 
  and submit those changes as a PR.
- We follow the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guidelines][] â€”
  for example, don't use "i.e." or "e.g.", 
  and avoid writing in first person. 
  You can start with the
  [style guide highlights](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights) 
  or the [word list](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list), 
  or use the search bar that's at the top of every style guide page. 

> We truly thank you for your willingness and helpfulness
> in keeping the website docs up to date!
